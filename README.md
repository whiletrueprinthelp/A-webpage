# A-webpage
This is the first website I tried making after learning html and css! Since there were no requirements on what the content of the website should be, I randomly added encryption in the main webpage to confuse people who visit the site :D

## What the webpage does
The website starts off at index.html, where the viewer would choose between going deeper into the website or going to the github repository that this website is being held in.

If the user chose to go deeper into the website, they would be lead into the page of middle.html, where they have to confirm that they want to go deeper in by clicking 'Yes', or if they do not wish to anymore, they can click 'No' and be led back to the first page index.html.

If the user clicked 'Yes', they would be led to the page main.html, where the actual contents of the site is being stored. 
At the bottom of the page, there is a form (that does not exactly work as even if the input is blank, the submit button can still be pressed). Upon pressing the submit button, the user is led to forgotten.html, where the link of this github repository appears once more.
